## Why CrustScript?


# High Performance with Familiar Syntax: 
CrustScript brings Rust’s blazing speed and memory efficiency to your projects while letting you code in a JavaScript/TypeScript style you already know. Instead of trying to force JavaScript on the backend, CrustScript offers the best of both worlds—Rust's powerhouse performance with syntax that feels like home.

# Rock-Solid Reliability: 
Leveraging Rust’s robust type system and ownership model, CrustScript guarantees memory safety and thread reliability. This means fewer bugs and more predictable behavior at compile-time, giving you peace of mind when building complex systems—all without abandoning the language patterns you’re used to.

# Enhanced Developer Productivity: 
With comprehensive documentation, intuitive compiler diagnostics, and state-of-the-art tooling (think built-in package management, automated build tools, and integrated formatters and linters), CrustScript is engineered to streamline your workflow. Enjoy a smooth migration from conventional JS/TS development to a backend environment that truly performs without the learning curve of a completely new language.

Embrace CrustScript, and step into a world where you can harness Rust’s advanced safety and performance benefits while staying in the comfort zone of JavaScript/TypeScript. This unique blend allows you to build robust backend services with the productivity and expressiveness you already love.([Clippy]) and editor support ([rust-analyzer]).
